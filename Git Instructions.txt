Open GitBash to open the terminal

$ ls   // reads the contents in your current directory
$ cd <subdir_name>  // goes into the named directory
$ cd ..             // goes up one directory (the parent directory)

$ git status       // shows the changes in your local repository (NOT in remote repository)
$ git add <file_name>  // "tracks" the file named, so its changes can be added to the remote repository
$ git add .            // tracks all new changes made in your local repo, to be added to the remote repository

$ git commit -m "<message>"  // creates a commit, with the tracked files, and the message provided
$ git push                   // pushes local commits to the remote repository

$ git pull                   // grabs all changes in the remote repository and puts them in your local repository

$ git diff                   // shows all local changes made since last committing
$ git diff <file_name>       // shows all local changes made to the specified file since committing


Tutorial 1:  Adding files to the remot repository:
$ cd location/of/local_repository
$ git status                       //make sure the changes you made are showing up 
$ git add <file1> <file2> <file3>...   //track those files to be committed
$ git commit -m "I'm adding files 1-3 to the remote repository"
$ git push
